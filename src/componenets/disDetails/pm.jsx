<p class="">
powdery mildew, plant disease of worldwide occurrence that causes a powdery growth on the surface of leaves, buds, young shoots, fruits, and flowers. Powdery mildew is caused by many specialized races of fungal species in the genera Erysiphe, Microsphaera, Phyllactinia, Podosphaera, Sphaerotheca, and Uncinula. Moderate temperatures (20-25?C); relatively dry conditions (unlike downy mildews).
</p>        


<p class="">

Symptoms : Small, white, powdery patches on most above-ground surfaces; usually observed first on undersides of leaves but eventually cover both surfaces; affected leaves become yellow, then brown and papery and die.

</p>

<p class="">

Host Plants : Wide host range and very common, especially in greenhouse crops: cucumber; melons; pumpkin; zucchini;parsnip; beetroot; potato; herbs; peas; bitter melon;tomato; capsicum; Brussels sprouts; cabbage; swedes.

</p>

<p class="">

Prevent Methods: Maintain adequate spacing between plants and keep them far enough away from walls and fences to ensure good air circulation and help reduce relative humidity. Locate plants in proper sunlight according to their needs. Maintain healthy plants by removing dead or diseased foliage.
