            Spider mites are members of the Tetranychidae family, which includes about 1,200 species. They are part of the subclass Acari. Spider mites generally live on the undersides of leaves of plants, where they may spin protective silk webs, and they can cause damage by puncturing the plant cells to feed.Excessive nitrogen leads to small compounds known as”funny proteins.” These proteins don't help the plant, but they do make plant sap sweeter, leading to an increased attack of sucking insects like spider mites. To avoid this problem, apply a balanced spectrum of nutrients, and only apply what your plant needs.

            Prevent Methods: Washing plant foliage using a soft cloth or a forceful spray of lukewarm water can help reduce the spider mite population if done repeatedly. Other control options include treating plants with an insecticide containing permethrin or pyrethrin. Insecticidal soap and horticultural oil are also effective.
